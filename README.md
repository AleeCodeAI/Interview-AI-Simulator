<h2>Behind the Project</h2>
<p>
This project reflects my passion for developing practical AI tools that help people prepare smarter.  
The goal was to create an experience where conversational AI could analyze inputs, ask relevant questions,  
and simulate the pressure and rhythm of a real interview — all within a minimal and accessible interface.
